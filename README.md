Deep Learning of Narrative
==========================

1. Input docs as json lines
   lazy or one line at a time?
   
2. tokenize
   capitals (char-rnn annotation trick?), punctuation, numbers, 
   
3. rare vs. common words/terms

4. word2vec vs. semantic embeddings
   why is word to vec handwavy about semantic localtity
   when DSR is clear -- shoule we use DSR?
   
4. char-rnn vs. word-rnn (LTST)
   word on the street is word for performance and profit
